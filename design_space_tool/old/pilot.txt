Test Decision
Description
Test Decision thingy
Rationale
Why not indeed?
Trigger Type Menu
Description
Top level menu to select a trigger/action type
Rationale
Users need a high level view to be able to choose triggers or actions. Needs to be suitably general and unambiguous. E.g. "SMS" or "Webpage".
Trigger Type Submenu
Description
Select the exact trigger/action from an area selected in the main menu. For example, "receive a message" (under an "SMS" menu) or "at 5pm" (under a "Time" menu).
Rationale
As the user has already selected a general area, they need to be able to pick their exact trigger or action.
Trigger/Action Parameters Menu
Description
For a given trigger/action, a choice of parameters to personalise it even further. These can link to other triggers.
Rationale
Users should be able to personalise a trigger/action with respect to that trigger/action. For example being able to construct a text message to send, or restrict what is being gathered in a trigger.
Ways of adding in logic to triggers
Description
A method for adding in basic logic to triggers - "and", "or", "if", "else".
Rationale
Users can use this basic logic to combine triggers and actions and make them more useful.
Drag connections between triggers and actions
Description
Users should be able to drag a connection from one trigger/action to another. This could perhaps also incorporate the logic with different forms of lines to connect.
Rationale
Users should be able to connect triggers and actions in a visible way to give an overview of the composition. This also allows for easy editing.
Favourites Menu
Description
A list of triggers or actions that a user has 'favourited'. Possibly also a list of recently or most used items.
Rationale
Users will probably use some actions more than others depending on their daily routine. This allows quick access to them without searching through menus and submenus.
Ability to share compositions
Description
A user can share a composition once it is created so that others can use it.
Rationale
Users should be be able to share their compositions with friends. An online collection of these lets users discover compositions that they may never have thought of but are useful to them.
Save compositions
Description
A user can save a composition once completed.
Rationale
Users should be able to save compositions so that if they switch it off they can reactivate it later.
Overall On/Off switch
Description
A button to turn the overall composition on and off.
Rationale
Users may wish to switch off all compositions (if they are on holiday for example) and this should be easy to do.
Individual On/Off Control
Description
Each composition should have a switch to turn on/off
Rationale
Users need to easily be able to switch compositions on and off, in case they have no need for a composition.
Save customised triggers/actions
Description
The ability to save a trigger or action with set parameters.
Rationale
A user may commonly use a trigger or action with a specific set of parameters (i.e. text messages from a particular number) and there should be the ability to save these are reuse them with the parameters already set.
Ability to edit compositions
Description
Compositions should be editable after creation.
Rationale
Users often make mistakes or their needs change so a composition should be editable and not fixed once created.
Test composition button
Description
A button to test a composition, either with specified data or a sample piece of data.
Rationale
Users may not be sure that their composition does what they expect, or want reassurance that it works. A button should be available to test out a composition, either doing the action if the data is specified (i.e. getting a copy of a webpage) or with sample data (i.e. sending a sample text message).
Delete compositions
Description
A button to delete a composition
Rationale
Users should be able to delete compositions that do not work or that they do not use to avoid a cluttered interface.
List of currently running compositions
Description
A list of compositions that are currently running
Rationale
Users should be able to see which compositions are currently enabled to give an overview of what is occurring.
Sortable list of compositions
Description
The list of compositions (currently running, and all compositions) should be sortable by a range of metrics. In particular, when a composition was last run, and how many times a composition has run.
Rationale
Users should be able to see which compositions are running most frequently and which most recently. This also allows them to help diagnose any problems if the composition tool claims a composition has run, whereas the user sees no 'real life' evidence for this.
Large "Make Composition" button on opening
Description
The first page/screen/window of the tool should have a large button to make a new composition.
Rationale
Users should be able to quickly get into the area for making a composition to allow for maximum productivity.
Colour coding/Logos for each Trigger/Action type
Description
Each high-level service type should have either a colour coding or large easy to see logo. This should be prominent both in menus and in displaying compositions.
Rationale
Users should be able to easy distinguish between compositions or service choices at a glance.
