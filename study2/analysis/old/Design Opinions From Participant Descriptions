Design Opinions From Participant Customs

1
Abstract design focussing on WHAT components do rather than how the tool combines them.
Some thought about how data might flow or how components could be connected.
Not usable alone

2
Very brief, also abstract.
Some consideration of platform, and composition structure
Not usable alone

3
Relatively abstract, paying particular attention to the initial stage of identifing the problem that the user is trying to solve.
Other abstract concepts
Not really usable alone, could be used as a base

4
Emphasis on sharing/collaboration
Discussion of data passing, interaction and component creation
Potentially usablee

5
Metaphor for repreesntation/interaction
Not with just this

6 
[Might be the best one to scrap because it doesn't appear to be the right task]
I really don't know what this is
No chance it could be used as a design

7
N/A

8 - Very good
Concrete
Focus on discovery - browsing, suggestions, examples, etc.
Also composition - representation, data complexity, etc.
Support - forums
Could easily be used as a design

9
N/A

10 Tiny
Single option about discovery of components
Not usable alone

11
N/A

12
N/A

13 Abstract
Discovery, suggestions 
and composition
Some discussion of composite management
Could be used as a base

14
Discussion of composition representation and interaction
Some abstract concepts
Could be used as a base

15
Abstract
Could be used as a base
Quite broad in terms of coverage - discovery, composition represenation, etc.

16
Abstract
Could be used as a base
Covers discovery, help, and interactions with composites

17
Concrete, comprehensive
Discussion of
	Components - discovery, types
	Compositiont - connections logic
	Device & user management
	Failsafes
Could be used as most of a design

18
Concrete, also comprehensive
Covers a broad range of concepts within SC
Could easily be used as a strong base

19
Elements not contained in prior DS
Not a base

20
Concrete but focused, focuses on composition and discovery
Various other non-functional attributes
Broad base

21
Specific to a domain
Missing the general composition properties
General base

22
Abstract, broad ranging decisions.
Vague base

23
Specific to aspects of interacting with composites, and how they can use this.
Needs massive extension to be used as a base.

24
Interactions with composites are very common
Representations of composition
Also discovery
Vague base

25
N/A

26
General, covering composition
Also presents some discussion about general interaction with the tool itself
Could be used as a base

27
N/A

28
General, widely ranged but not much
Covers aspects such as discovery, composition.
General base

29
N/A

30
General, fairly abstract.
Interactions with components, composites
Types of components
Interaction with tool, and assistance provided

31

32
N/A

33
N/A

34
Domain specific, mainly focused on features
Also assistance provided by the tool
Could be used as a specific design in that domain, but its relation to service-oriented computing is dubious

35
Specific
Representation of composition
Accessibility

36
N/A

37
Specific, broad ranging
Discovery
Visualisation, representation
User discussion
Strong base

Composition process
User profiles
Reasonable base
