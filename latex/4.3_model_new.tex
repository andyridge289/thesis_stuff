\section{The Model}
\label{sec:ds:model}

This section presents the concepts within the model, which provides an effective overview of the design of SC tools. We present each of our 4 sub-models separately, listing both the decisions and related requirements.

For each concept in the DS sub-model, we will discuss its origins, at what point it was added to the DS model, and if applicable where it was added from. Sub-concepts will indicate their parent in the DS sub-model where applicable. 

Some decisions in the model are used to provide added structure to a sub-model, as well as being a decision that needs to be made. If a decision has only decisions as it's children, the sub-decision may be considered as \emph{both} a decision and an option.

\subsection{Functional Sub-model}

Figure \ref{ds:fig:functional} shows a graphical representation of the relationships between the design decisions and options in the functional DS sub-model.

\begin{figure}[htb]

	\caption{The functional DS sub-model}
	\label{ds:fig:functional}
\end{figure}

\clearpage

The functional sub-model is grouped by an adaptation activities of the SC lifecycle that are identified by Mehandjiev et al. \cite{Mehandjiev2012}. They identify a set of stages that make up the SC process, similar to the dynamic SC lifecycle presented by Silva et al. \cite{Silva2008}. Silva's lifecycle is presented in Section \ref{bg:sec:lifecycle}. In the rest of this discussion, we will refer to Silva et al.'s lifecycle as \emph{L1} and Mehandjiev et at.'s lifecycle as \emph{L2}.


\emph{L1} is broader in scope than \emph{L2}, since it also includes the creation and publication of the service into the SC tool, which is necessary before composition can occur. However, \emph{L2} is broken down into much more fine-grained activities within each main stage of the lifecycle. A mapping between the two is shown in Figure \ref{ds:fig:lifecyle_mapping}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{images/ds/lifecycle_comparison}
	\caption{The mapping between the stages presented in the the two different views of SC lifecycles: \emph{L1} \cite{Silva2008} and \emph{L2} \cite{Mehandjiev2012}.}
	\label{ds:fig:lifecyle_mapping}
\end{figure}

There are two levels of granularity across the two lifecycles: a high level in \emph{L1} and the stages in \emph{L2}, and a lower level of granularity in the activities of \emph{L2}. We feel that neither of these two levels are particularly useful in the DS model, since the lower level is too specific and the higher level is not specific enough. Thus, we decided to use a set of decisions that was in the middle ground between these two levels of granularity:
\begin{itemize*}
	\item Creation \& Publication
	\item Specification
	\item Request
	\item Discovery
	\item Composition
	\item Verification \& Validation
	\item Annotation \& Deployment
	\item Execution
\end{itemize*}

\subsubsection{Creation \& Publication}

\textbf{Creation \& Publication} \hfill Lit review \cite{Silva2008} \\ \emph{Decision} \hfill 

Creation and publication is a pre-requisite for the composition process in that in order for there to be component services to be available to be composed they must first be created and then published \cite{Silva2008}.

This area is a prime example of where the tool review is deficient -- the creation and publication process was not visible in any of the tools that we reviewed, hence no options are currently present in the model to solve the creation and publication decision.

\subsubsection{Specification} 

\textbf{Specification} \hfill Prior model collation \cite{Mehandjiev2012} \\ \emph{Decision} \hfill 

The specification phase is the stage at which the user of the SC tool determines what they need from the composite that they seek to create. This stage is present in \emph{L2}, but isn't discussed in \emph{L1}, presumably because it is a stage at which the tool can have little impact on the user who is carrying out the specification.

\textbf{No specification} \hfill Tool review \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Specification}

None of the prior models considered any options for assisting with the specification process, nor was it discussed in the literature, nor supported in any of the tool reviews. This leads us to believe that this process is one that is part of the SC process, but one that is not explicitly supported by the tool, instead it is left to the user.

\subsubsection{Request}

\textbf{Request} \hfill Prior model collation \cite{Mehandjiev2012} \\ \emph{Decision} \hfill 

The request stage of the process is presented in \emph{L1}, and focuses on the mechanism that the user uses to translate their requirements (i.e. the output of the specification phase) into being able to perform discovery, which is the next phase in the composition process. The request phase is meant to exist in an SC tool that provides fully automated SC, which has been cited as being unrealistic with current service-oriented technologies \cite{Vulcu2008}.

\textbf{Search} \hfill Prior model collation \cite{Grammel2010} \\ \emph{Decision} \hfill solves \textbf{Request}

Searching covers both searching for components that could be used in a composition and searching for composites that have already been created to meet the user's needs. This decision was identified in the requirements gathering process, where participants indicated that this would be their preferred mechanism for finding what they need in a SC tool.

Searching wasn't identified as a concept from the tool review, which was due to the limited number of components that are available in the tool -- if there are only a limited number of components, a search isn't required.

\textbf{Search metrics} \hfill Requirements gathering study \\ \emph{Decision} \hfill solves \textbf{Search}

This decision represents the different ways that the user of the tool can perform the search. It was added to group together options related to search that were elicited in the requirements gathering process.

\textbf{Search by name} \hfill Requirements gathering study \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Search metrics}

Searching by name was identified in the requirements gathering process as a property of the services available in the tool that the user could use to search for services that they want to use. The name of the service is a prominent attribute that we would expect to be one that users would want to use for search.

\textbf{Search by function} \hfill Requirements gathering study \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Search metrics}

Searching by function was identified in the requirements gathering process as a property of services available in the tool that the user could use to search for services that they want to use. The function of the service is a more unusual aspect of the services that could be used to search, as it is difficult to determine how this function would be represented.

\subsubsection{Discovery}

\textbf{Discovery} \hfill Prior model collation \cite{Mehandjiev2012} \\ \emph{Decision} \hfill 

The discovery phase of the SC lifecycle is the point at which the tool presents the user with the components that they want to use in composition, or the results of the search that they performed in the last phase. In this sub-model, discovery is broken down into two further decisions: the discovery mechanism and the entities that are discoverable using the tool.

\paragraph{Discovery Mechanism}

\textbf{Discovery mechanism} \hfill Tool review \\ \emph{Decision} \hfill 

Discovery mechanisms are the ways that the user can discover services using the tool -- either components to use in composition or composites that have already been created that they might be able to use or modify.

This decision was created to group together the suggestions that were found in prior DS models, and the discovery mechanisms identified in the tool review.

\textbf{Browsing} \hfill Tool review \\ \emph{Decision} \hfill solves \textbf{Discovery mechanism}

Browsing was identified in the tool review as a common mechanism used by SC tools to present services to the user. This decision was created as a separate parent decision to group together the different types of browsing that can occur, as well as the options that browsing can have.

\textbf{Browsing \& filtering} \hfill Tool review \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Browsing}

Browsing and filtering represents the option to filter the list of services that are being viewed as part of browsing, regardless of the representation being used during the browsing process. This option was also added as part of the tool review, with a few of the SC tools offering this feature.

\textbf{Browse a list} \hfill Tool review \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Browsing}

Browsing a list is the standard mechanism for browsing services that was found in the tool review, although the representations of the lists differed somewhat. The discussion of the attributes that services presented is discussed further in the service sub-model.

\textbf{Grouping} \hfill Requirements gathering study \\ \emph{Decision} \hfill solves \textbf{Browsing}

Grouping of the services was identified by the participants in our requirements gathering study as an important mechanism for browsing through the available services in the tool.

\textbf{Grouping metrics} \hfill Requirements gathering study \\ \emph{Decision} \hfill solves \textbf{Grouping}

Various different metrics were identified by the participants in our requirements gathering study, and this decision was added to group these together under one decision.

\textbf{Group by function} \hfill Prior model collation \cite{Grammel2010} \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Grouping metrics}

A popular approach to grouping services is grouping by the function that the service performs, which could also be described as splitting them into categories. This was identified in the DS model by Grammel et al. \cite{Grammel2010}, as well as being suggested by participants in the requirements gathering study.

\textbf{Group by location} \hfill Requirements gathering study \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Grouping metrics}

Grouping the services by their location was a concept suggested by participants in the requirements gathering study. This relies on the architecture of the tool providing services from more than one location. In the case of the prototype used in the requirements study, the users of the prototype were able to browse through and acquire services, so this ``location'' was based on whether they had already acquired that service or not.

It could also represent services that are based on the Web (e.g. search, lookups, social media, etc.), vs. those that are available on the device (e.g. accelerometer, SMS, etc.)

\textbf{Group by cost} \hfill Requirements gathering study \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Grouping metrics}

Grouping by cost relies on there being some monetary value attached to the service. This was also identified in the requirements gathering study, although its identification is unexpected because the study did not present them with any SC tools that presented a monetary value with the services it provided.

\textbf{Group by service provider} \hfill Tool review \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Grouping metrics}

Grouping by service provider relies on a set of services all being provided by the same provider. For example, \emph{Atooma} provides groups of services to be used with Twitter, Facebook, and Google Drive.

\textbf{Group by rating} \hfill Requirements gathering study \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Grouping metrics}

Grouping by rating relies on users of the tool being able to assign a star rating to services that can be used with the tool. Whilst rating was available in some of the tools in the tool review, grouping by rating was not. This option was identified by participants in our requirements gathering study, and we suggest there are two possible reasons for it being identified by our participants:
\begin{itemize*}
	\item They combined other elements from the DS model -- ratings and grouping.
	\item They took influence from other design spaces (for example apps and app stores).
\end{itemize*}

\textbf{Group by recently used} \hfill Requirements gathering study \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Grouping metrics}

Grouping services by how recently they were used wasn't present in any of the tools presented to the participants in the requirements gathering study. This option also presents overlap between different design spaces.

\textbf{Customisation of grouping} \hfill Requirements gathering study \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Grouping}

Participants in our requirements gathering study suggested that if the tool allowed services to be grouped, then the grouping should be customisable.

\textbf{Manual grouping} \hfill Requirements gathering study \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Grouping}

Services should be grouped manually by the user, allowing them to put them in any groups that they want.

\textbf{Tagging} \hfill Prior model collation \cite{Grammel2010} \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Browsing}

Instead of gathering services into groups, tags can be applied to them that categorise them by various properties. Traditionally services would only be able to be in a single group, but they would be able to have multiple tags.

\textbf{Suggestions} \hfill Prior model collation \cite{Grammel2010} \\ \emph{Decision} \hfill solves \textbf{Discovery mechanism}

The system provides the user with some form of suggestion to aid the discovery process.

\textbf{Context-specific suggestions} \hfill Prior model collation \cite{Grammel2010} \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Suggestions}

Context-specific suggestions are suggestions that are made to the user based upon some particular context change that occurs.

\textbf{Recommendations from friends} \hfill Requirements gathering study \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Suggestions}

Recommendations from friends relies on some notion of social interaction between users of the tool. This could either piggyback some social network or building a social feature into the tool. This option was identified in the requirements gathering study.

\textbf{``Matching'' components} \hfill Requirements gathering study \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Suggestions}

Suggesting ``matching components'' relies on the passing of data between components in the composition, and the idea of matching data types in the inputs and outputs of these components. Thus, if the user selects a component with a particular output, the tool can suggest other components whose inputs match with the output of the original selection. This option was identified in the tool review, where participants identified potential frustration when they were allowed to select components whose inputs did not match, but then they could not connect them together.

\textbf{Other recommendations} \hfill Tool review \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Suggestions}

Other recommendations are recommendations that don't fit within any of the other categories, which were present in various tools that were covered in the tool review.

\paragraph{Discoverable Entities}

\textbf{Discoverable entities} \hfill Tool review \\ \emph{Decision} \hfill 

Discoverable entities are the entities (i.e. services) that the user can discover using the tool.

\textbf{Components} \hfill Tool review \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Discoverable entities}

Discoving components is mandatory in any SC tool that is not fully automatic, since to be able to compose components together to create a new composite, the user must first be able to discover the components with which they are performing composition.

\textbf{Composites} \hfill Tool review \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Discoverable entities}

Composite discovery means that the tool allows the user to discover composites -- either created by other users of the tool, or provided as samples by the creator of the tool.

\subsubsection{Composition}

\textbf{Composition} \hfill Prior model collation \cite{Mehandjiev2012} \\ \emph{Decision} \hfill 

The composition stage is the point at which the user of the tool has discovered the components that they wish to use and they are then performing the composition. In practice, this stage overlaps somewhat with the discovery stage, in that the user may discover and compose components one at a time.

There are three different ``types'' of service composition based on the type of object being composed, or how the composition is arranged:
\begin{itemize*}
	\item Process composition
	\item Data composition
	\item Interface composition
\end{itemize*}

\textbf{Process composition} \hfill Prior model collation \cite{Minhas2012,Daniel2007} \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Composition}

Process composition requires the components in the composition to form a series of processes, which can then be combined together to create one composite process. The components may optionally pass data between one another, which can be manipulated by the other processes. Process composition was identified in the prior model collation stage -- the model created by Minhas et al. \cite{Minhas2012}, which was originally focussed on Mashups. The literature review stage confirmed that process composition is also present in SC as a whole \cite{Daniel2007}.

\textbf{Data composition} \hfill Prior model collation \cite{Minhas2012,Daniel2007} \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Composition}

Data composition is often thought of as being different to process composition, although they are both structured in the same way. Data composition is based on manipulating data by combining processes to manipulate this data. In mashups, they often rely on data feeds, or APIs \cite{Minhas2012}. As with process composition, data composition was first identified in mashups in Minhas et al.'s model \cite{Minhas2012}, before also being identified in SC in the literature review stage \cite{Daniel2007}.

\textbf{UI composition} \hfill Prior model collation \cite{Minhas2012,Daniel2007} \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Composition}

User interface (UI) composition allows users to create new interfaces by combining previously created interfaces components, as well as various other interface-related aspects of composition. As with the other two types of composition, this was identified in mashups in the DS model by Minhas et al. \cite{Minhas2012}, before being backed up in the literature review \cite{Daniel2007}

\textbf{UI creation method} \hfill Prior model collation \\ \emph{Decision} \hfill solves \textbf{Composition}

This decision is meant to group together the various different methods for performing UI composition that have been identified in prior DS models. Each of these different methods of UI composition/generation were identified in the prior DS model created by Grammel et al. \cite{Grammel2010}

\textbf{Automatic UI generation} \hfill Prior model collation \cite{Grammel2010} \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{UI composition method}

In automatic UI generation, the interface is generated automatically from some other information. For instance, in Web Services, it is possible to generate a form-like interface from a WSDL description of the service, since the WSDL provides information such as the names of properties and the type of data that they are expecting \cite{Grammel2010}.

\textbf{Webpage composition} \hfill Prior model collation \cite{Minhas2012} \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{UI composition method}

Webpage composition is a specific form for UI composition that allows the user of the tool to browse, compose and edit Web pages or their content in order to create a new, composite Web-based interface \cite{Grammel2010}. Webpage composition normally takes place at the presentation layer (see Section \ref{bg:sec:layers}).

\textbf{Visual UI composition} \hfill Prior model collation \cite{Grammel2010} \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{UI composition method}

Visual UI composition is based on the mechanism that it used to create the UI -- the components are combined visually, by dragging components, etc.

\textbf{Textual UI composition} \hfill Prior model collation \cite{Grammel2010} \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{UI composition method}

Textual UI composition relies on some text-based language to specify the elements and layout of the UI.

\subsubsection{Verification and Validation}

\textbf{Verification \& validation} \hfill Prior model collation \cite{Mehandjiev2012} \\ \emph{Decision} \hfill 

Verification \& validation is the stage in the SC lifecycle at which the user has already composed their service, and they are now seeking to validate that the composite that they have created to ensure that it performs the task that they sought it to complete when they envisioned its creation.

\textbf{Testing} \hfill Prior model collation \cite{Grammel2010} \\ \emph{Decision} \hfill solves \textbf{Verification \& validation}

One mechanism for the user to ensure that their created composite does what it should is to test that composite by executing it before it gets deployed. Testing was identified as a Software Engineering technique in the prior DS model created by Grammel et al. \cite{Grammel2010}.

\textbf{Simulate testing of triggers} \hfill Requirements gathering study \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Testing}

Of the SC tools in the tool review that supported triggers (components that are activated upon some event-based trigger), none of them support testing. In the requirements gathering study, participants identified that testing of the composites that contain these triggers would be useful and hence is something that should be included in a tool.

\textbf{Test mode for components} \hfill Requirements gathering study \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Testing}

Another instance of a problem with testing that was identified by participants in our requirements gathering study was components whose execution would have some impact on the ``outside world''. For these components, they indicated that there would need to be some test mode where they could run the composite containing the component without the component affecting the outside world.

\textbf{Dummy test data} \hfill Requirements gathering study \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Testing}

Similar to having a test mode due to components affecting the outside world, there are components that perform a lookup, for example on the Web. Participants in our requirements gathering study identified that it might be useful to get the component to return some sample data when performing testing, especially if the later components in the composite rely on the initial component returning a particular answer.

\textbf{Debugging} \hfill Prior model collation \cite{Grammel2010} \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Testing}

Debugging is suggested as a software engineeering technique in Grammel et al.'s prior DS model \cite{Grammel2010}. It is a much more technically oriented option that would normally be in traditional software engineering approaches.

\subsubsection{Annotation and Deployment}

\textbf{Annotation \& deployment} \hfill Prior model collation \cite{Mehandjiev2012} \\ \emph{Decision} \hfill 

Annotation and deployment is the part of the process where the user is able to save the composite that have created so that it can be executed (or edited, shared, etc.) later.

\textbf{Code generation} \hfill Prior model collation \cite{Pietschmann2010} \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Annotation \& deployment}

Code generation is a deployment method that generates some code (e.g. XML) to represent the composite that can be interpreted and executed by another system. This method is often used in web-based composition tools \cite{Pietschmann2010}.

\textbf{Interpretation} \hfill Prior model collation \cite{Mehandjiev2012} \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Annotation \& deployment}

Interpretation deploys the composite service within the application in which it is created, and that tool then interprets some internal representation of the composite and hence executes it.

\textbf{Compilation} \hfill Prior model collation \cite{Pietschmann2010} \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Annotation \& deployment}

Compilation deploys composites by creating a standalone executable application for the composite. This would normally be executable on the platform on which the tool runs.

\subsubsection{Execution}

\textbf{Execution} \hfill Prior model collation \cite{Mehandjiev2012} \\ \emph{Decision} \hfill 

Execution is the final main phase of the composition process, although it can optionally follow repetitions of earlier phases, for example editing and verifying the composite at a later date.

\textbf{In-tool execution} \hfill Tool review \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Execution}

This is analogous to interpretation, where the execution of the composite takes place inside the tool in which it was created.

\textbf{Create new app} \hfill Tool review \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Execution}

This is analagous to compilation, where the tool creates an executable application out of a composite, which the user is then able to execute independently of the SC tool.

\subsection{Non-Functional Sub-model}

Figures \ref{ds:fig:nonfunctional1} and \ref{ds:fig:nonfunctional2} show a graphical representation of the non-functional sub-model of the whole DS model. Most of the structure of the non-functional sub-model is based on the prior model created by Aghaee et al. \cite{Aghaee2012}, and provided the general structure for this sub-model of the DS model.

\end{figure}

\clearpage

\subsubsection{Interaction Technique}

\textbf{Interaction technique} \hfill Prior model collation \cite{Aghaee2012} \\ \emph{Decision} \hfill 

Interaction techniques are the mechanisms that the tool provides to allow the user to interact with the composition process, or components and links within the composition. Note that in the majority of cases, the interaction mecahnism also reflects the representation of the composition process, although it can be independent of the representation of the components or links between components.

\textbf{Non-language-based interaction} \hfill Prior model collation \\ \emph{Decision} \hfill solves \textbf{Interaction technique}

This decision focuses in those interaction techniques that do not involve some form of (either visual or textual) language. It was created in the initial collation stage to group together the options providing non-language based interactions.

\textbf{Spreadsheet interaction} \hfill Prior model collation \cite{Aghaee2012,Minhas2012,Fischer2009} \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Non-language-based interaction}

Interacting with a spreadsheet is an interaction mechanism that has been used in creating mashups \cite{Skrobo2011}, and hence could be extended to work with SC tools in general. Having a spreadsheet interaction mechanism means that the representation of the composition process must also be a spreadsheet.

\textbf{Dialog/form-based interaction} \hfill Prior model collation \cite{Aghaee2012} \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Non-language-based interaction}

In a dialog/form-based interaction technique, users enter data into a form to control the composition process. Typically the form controls are based on the intputs to the component, and the user is able to connect together the forms represent the different components in the composition \cite{Aghaee2012}.

\textbf{WYSIWYG interaction} \hfill Prior model collation \cite{Aghaee2012} \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Non-language-based interaction}

WYSIWYG -- ``What you see is what you get'' is based on the premise of presenting the user with the view of the component that they will interact with when the composite service is being executed \cite{Aghaee2012}.

\textbf{Programming by Demonstration (PbD)} \hfill Prior model collation \cite{Grammel2010,Aghaee2012,Minhas2012,Fischer2009} \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Non-language-based interaction}

Programming by demonstration (PbD) relies on the user of the tool demonstrating the task they want to be performed. The tool then records the steps in this demonstration, and is able to automate them. The macro recorder in the MS Office suite is a popular example of PbD in action.

\textbf{Drag \& drop interaction} \hfill Prior model collation \cite{Pietschmann2010} \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Non-language-based interaction}

Drag \& drop interaction means that the user interacts with the components in the composition by dragging them around some canvas, and then dropping them in the right position.

\textbf{Programming by Example Modification (PbEM)} \hfill Prior model collation \cite{Aghaee2012} \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Non-language-based interaction}

Programming by example modification (PbEM) (also referred to as ``fork and edit'') is where the user acquires composites that have been created already as a base example, and is then able to edit this example to reduce the burden in the composition process. 

\textbf{Language-based interaction} \hfill Prior model collation \cite{Minhas2012} \\ \emph{Decision} \hfill solves \textbf{Interaction technique}

Language-based interactions rely on the user of the tool manipulating the composition by editing some language.

\textbf{Domain-specific Language (DSL)} \hfill Prior model collation \\ \emph{Decision} \hfill solves \textbf{Language-based interaction}

A DSL is a language that is specialsed so that it can be used more effectively in a particular domain. This decision was first identified in Prior model collation to group together specific instances of domain-specific languages, and was then reinforced in Lit review from the literature \cite{Skrobo2011}.

\textbf{Visual DSL} \hfill Prior model collation \cite{Grammel2010,Aghaee2012} \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{DSL}

A visual DSL is a DSL that doesn't rely solely on text to convey its meaning, it might instead use some form of graphical representation as the syntax to convey the semantics of the language.

\textbf{Textual DSL} \hfill Prior model collation \cite{Aghaee2012} \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{DSL}

A textual DSL is a DSL defined with a textual syntax. This tends to mean that they are expressive, but have similar barriers to learning to full programming languages \cite{Aghaee2012}.

\textbf{Full language} \hfill Prior model collation \cite{Fischer2009,Pietschmann2010} \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Language-based interaction}

Full programming languages can also be used to perform composition, and are normally text-based. They tend to be more expressive than DSLs because they aren't specialised, but have a much higher learning barrier than DSLs.

\textbf{Blackboard} \hfill Prior model collation \cite{Aghaee2012} \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Interaction technique}

Blackboard interaction allows multiple users to edit mashups (and hence composition), where all users can see the edits that are being made in real time. This option is orthogonal to the other properties of interaction, it could either language- or non-language-based.

\subsubsection{Representation}

\textbf{Representation} \hfill Tool review \\ \emph{Decision} \hfill 

This decision was created in the tool review to group together the representation of the various different entities in the composition process.

\textbf{Composition representation} \hfill Tool review \\ \emph{Decision} \hfill solves \textbf{Representation}

This decision was also identified in the tool review, to group together the representation of the various aspects of the entities within and process of composition.

\textbf{Component representation} \hfill Tool review \\ \emph{Decision} \hfill solves \textbf{Composition representation}

The representation of components in the composition process can differ from the representation of components outside of this process, but still in the tool. This decision was identified in the tool review to group together the various differnet possible component representations.

\textbf{WYSIWYG component representation} \hfill Prior model collation \cite{Aghaee2012} \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Component representation}

A WYSIWYG component representation is linked to a WYSIWYG interaction technique, in that in order for the user to interact with the composition process in a WYSIWYG manner, the components must be represented as how they would appear when the composite is executed.

\textbf{Textual component representation} \hfill Prior model collation \cite{Aghaee2012,Fischer2009,Pietschmann2010} \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Component representation}

A textual component representation means that the component is represented solely with a piece of text. This would normally be the case in a textual DSL/full language reprensentation, although components are often represented with some text to convey, for example, the name of the service could be presented along with some graphical representation of the component. This option was identified in numerous prior DS models \cite{Aghaee2012,Fischer2009,Pietschmann2010}.

\textbf{Iconic component representation} \hfill Prior model collation \cite{Aghaee2012} \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Component representation}

An iconic representation means that the component is represented using its icon. Note that using an iconic representation does not preclude the inclusion of some other form of representation. This option was identified in the prior DS model created by Aghaee et al. \cite{Aghaee2012}.

\textbf{Form-element representation} \hfill Tool review  -- later iteration \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Component representation}

Form-element representation is linked to form-based interaction with the composition process, and represent each component as an element within the form. Each component would typically represent its inputs (if any are present) as input elements on the form. For example each input could be representated as a text field. This option was identified in a later iteration of the tool review.

\textbf{Flow diagram component representation} \hfill Tool review \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Component representation}

Flow diagram components tend to be simple box and line representations, which makes it a very simple representation of a component. This could be viewed as the most simple case of a form-based representation, where the component being represented doesn't have any inputs.

\textbf{``Flow'' representation} \hfill Prior model collation \\ \emph{Decision} \hfill solves \textbf{Composition representation}

Flow representation is the repesentation of what flows between the components, be that data, control, etc. This decision was created to group together the different options for representing what flow is present in the composition process.

\textbf{Control flow representation} \hfill Prior model collation \\ \emph{Decision} \hfill solves \textbf{Flow representation}

Control flow (also known as process flow) is the idea that control moves between the components when the results of the composition is executed. This decision was created to group together the different options for how control flow can be represented in composition. Control flow could also be thought of as the order of the execution, and requires that one component must be executed before another. Control flow allows the representation of branching, looping, etc.

Note that for the composition to make sense, control flow must always be present somewhere in the composition process, although it may not be presented to the user.

\textbf{Explicit control flow representation} \hfill Prior model collation \cite{Grammel2010,Aghaee2012} \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Control flow representation}

An explicit control flow representation shows the flow of control explicitly to the user.

\textbf{Implicit control flow representation} \hfill Prior model collation \cite{Aghaee2012} \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Control flow representation}

In the model in which it is suggested, an implicit control flow representation is stated as being the same as a data flow \cite{Aghaee2012}. However, we disagree with this premise since it is entirely possible that a composition representation could present neither control nor data flow.

\textbf{Data flow representation} \hfill Tool review \\ \emph{Decision} \hfill solves \textbf{Flow representation}

Data flow is the passing of data between components, although there is no implication as to the order in which the components are executed \cite{Wajid2010}. Data flow may not always be present, but if it is, there are two options for how it can be represented.

\textbf{Explicit data flow representation} \hfill Prior model collation \cite{Grammel2010} \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Data flow representation}

An explicit data flow representation explicitly presents the detail of the data that is being passed between the services.

\textbf{Implicit data flow representation} \hfill Tool review \\ \emph{Option} \hfill solves \textbf{Data flow representation}

Implicit data flow representation means that data flow is present in the composition process, but it is not represented explicitly to the user.

%\item \textbf{High} -- no knowledge is required, but flexibility is restricted to reusing and confusing mashups that are developed by others. Working with a high level of abstraction is supported by mashup development environments in several ways:
